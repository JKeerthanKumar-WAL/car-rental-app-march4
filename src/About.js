        <h1>About Car Rental</h1>
        It is typical, when renting a car, to be offered various forms of supplemental insurance and/or damage waivers as an optional extra at additional cost. There are several types of coverage:
        <br /><b>1. Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) -</b> covers the cost of damage to the rental vehicle, up to the full value of the vehicle, in the event of an accident. Typically LDW covers 100% of costs without a deductible additional fees. Note that LDW/CDW coverage is not insurance and does not offer the same coverage product as a damage insurance policy.
        <br /><b>2. Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) -</b> Generally covers the costs of damage from a moving accident. As the name suggests, the non-collision based damage is often not covered. In many cases, in the event of an accident, a fee or deductible applies.
        <br /><b>3. Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI) –</b> a product often sold in the U.S. which provides coverage in the event of an accident causing bodily injury or property damage to someone other than the renter and passengers.
        <br /><b>4. Personal Accident Insurance (PAI) –</b> covers medical costs and accidental death for the renter and passengers in the event of an accident during the rental.
        <br /><b>5. Personal Effects Coverage (PEC) –</b> insures against risk of loss or damage to the personal belongings of the renter (and sometimes the members of the renter's family while traveling with the renter) during the period of the rental.
        <br /><b>6. Excess Insurance –</b> Collision damage waiver, Theft and Third Party Liability coverage
        are often included in car rental prices in Europe, Africa, and Australasia.
        There is almost always an excess on these (also referred to as Super CDW, Non-Waiver, or Deductible), which involves an amount of money customers must pay
        in the event of damage, to discourage drivers from making small claims. A higher excess usually
        results in a lower upfront insurance cost for customers,
        but if damage occurs costing less than the excess to repair,
        then there is little incentive for customers to claim, benefiting the insurer.
